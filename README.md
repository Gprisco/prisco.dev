My Personal Website hosted on [prisco.dev](https://prisco.dev).

## Backend
The backend layer is built using node.js and express, I aim to extend it to add dynamic content to the website in future, for now it is not used at all.

## Frontend
The frontend layer is a React app developed with typescript. The data is hardcoded, the next step will be to integrate a database in the backend in which to store it.
