          <p>
            During the 2019-2020 I have been studying Swift Development at Apple
            Developer Academy in Naples. What made this year so awesome was the
            fact that I had the opportunity to experience UI/UX design and to
            see how the business stuff is managed when building a real-world
            product while specializing myself in developing backend solutions
            thanks to the Enterprise class.

          <p>
            During my first year at the Academy I realized how much I{" "}
            <b>loved</b> that kind of environment, with lots of amazing people
            and a lot of things to learn while actually doing them, so I'm now a
            Pier Student at Apple Developer Academy working on partner projects
            as a backend developer.
