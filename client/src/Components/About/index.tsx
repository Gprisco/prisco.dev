              Hello there! As I said, I am a software engineer, I like defining
              myself as a <b>Full-Stack Web Developer</b>, in my job I'm able to
              work with backend as well as with frontend. ‚ÄçI love what I do,
              it's <b>addictive</b>.‚Äç
              <br />
              <br />
              Computer programming has always been a passion for me and whether
              it regards developing a simple mobile application or building a
              complex system, I <b>thoroughly enjoy</b> doing so.
              <br />
              <br />
              What I love the most about my job is to collaborate and stay in
              contact with many <b>creative</b> people, for this reason I soon
              fell in love with my experience at the Apple Developer Academy in
              Naples.
              <br />
              <br />
              If you think you have some good ideas to share, I will be very
              happy to hear them from you, feel free to contact me{" "}

              <br />
              Actually I'm studying <b>Computer Science</b> at University of
              Salerno and I'm for the second year at Apple Developer Academy in
              Naples as a <b>Pier Student</b> and <b>backend developer</b>.
              <br />
              <br />
              When I'm not working alongside clients, I'm{" "}
              <b>constantly learning</b> new things, whether it is for the
              University or for some personal projects. As a matter of fact, I'm
              always trying to expand my tool-belt while still trying to reach
              an expertise level in Web Development. Currently I'm diving deeper
              in the AI world and I recently got the{" "}
              <i>"AI¬†Programming with Python" nanodegree</i> from Udacity.
