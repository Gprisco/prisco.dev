              I'm a <b>Software Engineer</b> and a student at University of
              Salerno. ‚ÄçI love what I do, it's <b>addictive</b>.‚Äç
              <br />
              <br />
              Computer programming has always been a passion for me and whether
              it regards developing a simple mobile application or building a
              complex system, I <b>thoroughly enjoy</b> doing so.
              <br />
              <br />
              What I love the most about my job is to collaborate and stay in
              contact with many <b>creative</b> people, for this reason I soon
              fell in love with my experience at the Apple Developer Academy in
              Naples.
              <br />
              <br />
              If you think you have some good ideas to share, I will be very
              happy to hear them from you, feel free to contact me{" "}

              Actually I'm studying <b>Computer Science</b> at University of

              When I'm not working alongside clients, I'm{" "}
              <b>constantly learning</b> new things, whether it is for the
              University or for some personal projects. As a matter of fact, I'm
              always trying to expand my tool-belt. Currently I'm diving deeper
              in the AI world and I recently got the{" "}
